# Java-project

This repository contains three data-related projects:
  1. Book exchange website (SQL, Python, relational database, HTML included)
  2. Gradient descent (R coding)
  3. Number catcher mini game (Java)
Besides, the use of each file is explained by annotations. 


Detailed explaination:
1. Book exchange website
  My group (Haoyan Zhang and I) had an idea of making a book exchange website. We designed the relational database with entity-relation diagram; realized the relational database system with PosgreSQL on Microsoft Azure; created the web front-end project by inserting SQL queries into Python code and designing HTML pages.

2. Gradient descent
  I created R functions for optimizing a univariate function with four different methods: golden section, bisection, Newton's method and secant method. Then I created R functions for gradient descent for fixed step (alpha) and steepest descent. Then I verify all the R functions with different univariate and multivariate functions.

3. Number catcher mini game
  Have fun.
